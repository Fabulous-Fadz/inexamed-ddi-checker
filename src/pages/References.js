        Some medicines are safe to take during pregnancy while other medicines
        may have adverse effects on the unborn baby. Most medicines are assigned
        one of five FDA Pregnancy categories to help identify the potential
        level of risk. It is very important to check each and every medicine,
        including over-the-counter medicines and natural supplements, to
        determine if they are safe to take while pregnant. This is especially
        important during the first trimester of pregnancy (0-13 weeks), a
        critical time for development of the embyro and fetus.{" "}
